# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

I built this sorting visualizer because I wanted to be able to see some of these algorithms in action.\
All you have to do to use this tool is select an algorithm, select an array size, and click on the 'Sort' button.\
Currently, this project supports seven sorting algorithms to choose from.\
Also, if you press the `W` key, the array will be presented in reverse sorted order which is the worst-case for most of these algorithms.\
For Bogosort, feel free to also open up the developer console of your browser and watch :)
