# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

I built this sorting visualizer because I wanted to be able to see some of these algorithms in action. 

All you have to do to use this tool is select an algorithm, select an array size, and click on the 'Sort' button. 

Currently, this project supports six sorting algorithms to choose from. 

Also, if you press the `W` key, the array will be presented in reverse sorted order which is the worst-case for most of these algorithms.

You can access the live version of this project by clicking here [here!](https://rai96.github.io/sorting-visualizer/)
